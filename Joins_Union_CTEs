Joins
Joins are crucial for combining rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Here are the main types of joins:

Inner Join: Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
Left Join: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows will have NULL values.
Right Join: Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table. Unmatched rows will have NULL values.
Full Join: Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Unmatched rows from both tables will have NULL values.
Cross Join: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, combining each row of the first table with each row of the second table.
Self Join: A table is joined with itself to combine rows within the same table.
Indexing
Indexes are used to speed up the retrieval of data from a database table. There are different types of indexes, including primary key, unique, regular, full-text, and spatial indexes.
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
CTEs are temporary result sets that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs improve the readability and maintainability of complex queries.
Union and Union All
The UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements. UNION returns only unique rows, while UNION ALL returns all rows, including duplicates.
